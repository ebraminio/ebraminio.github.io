title: "Quantum Computer (I)"
---

Initially, pardon me for various possible issues of this text (grammatical and factual, not an English native or strong physics background). The motivation here is to write a personal note about what I've learnt about quantum computing with a hope it would be useful others also.

So you are software programmers and maybe a programming languages geek and want to learn some Quantum Computer-ish thing? Quantum Computer is a new trend&mdash;perhaps not that new as the underlying concepts of quantum physics were discovered on early 20th century, but the new kind of computing gained more attraction recently at least, due to recent advancements like 2016 [physics Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2016/press.html) and stress companies like [IBM](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/) and [Google](https://research.google.com/pubs/QuantumAI.html) has put?&mdash;so it seems everyone is talking about nowadays (really?). Or maybe we can at least agree "Quantum Computer" title sounds cool, right?

Anyway, quantum physics as a science is at the same time both established and controversial; there are equations discovered on the field that are predicting correctly what experiments has shown and that is used in order to explain behavior of many modern discoveries we use in everyday life such as LEDs and transistors which is great, however philosophical interpretation of these equations doesn't seem to be that easy and there are several competing ideas about it, [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation), [Many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) and [de Broglie–Bohm interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie–Bohm_theory). The other issue is quantum physics is not that easy to be considered together with effectively and currently a separated part of physics, relativity. It also forces physics to give up one of these ideas, [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)) or [locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality), both beloved concepts we can't leave alone that easy. 

What we were talking about, Quantum Computer, right. Physic scientists were always puzzled about quantum physics and how or whether they can simulate the complex phenomena they are seeing. Don't know about accuracy of the following sentence or any of the other ones to be honest, someday scientists, [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) among them, decided to go on the reverse way and use this, lets say mechanics of quantum for building up a new type of computing instead.

To summarize and reexplain, quantum computer is a try to gain advantage of quantum mechanics for computing (well, obviously). Building quantum computer based on quantum physics is not very different from transistor computers and semiconductors in this sense that they was also explained by the same quantum mechanics. As at least there isn't really single interpretation of quantum mechanics that everyone accepts and all scientists have consensus on, sometimes it is best to just accept what you are being told about quantum computing as-is and don't try to go recursively deeper and deeper on the chain of reasonings of why and how; some parts of this science itself is still in doubt and maybe going on that path wouldn't be that productive.

(continued, edit: well, I have to say [this](https://www.clerro.com/guide/580/quantum-computing-explained) covers what I planned to say and more)
